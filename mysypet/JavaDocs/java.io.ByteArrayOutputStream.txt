ByteArrayOutputStream.size()	Returns the current size of the buffer
ByteArrayOutputStream.ByteArrayOutputStream(int)	Creates a new byte array output stream with a buffer capacity of the specified size in bytes
ByteArrayOutputStream.writeTo(OutputStream)	Writes the complete contents of this byte array output stream to the specified output stream argument as if by calling the output stream s write method using out write buf 0 count
ByteArrayOutputStream.close()	Closing a ByteArrayOutputStream has no effect The methods in this class can be called after the stream has been closed without generating an IOException
ByteArrayOutputStream.reset()	Resets the count field of this byte array output stream to zero so that all currently accumulated output in the output stream is discarded The output stream can be used again reusing the already allocated buffer space
ByteArrayOutputStream.toString(String)	Converts the buffer s contents into a string by decoding the bytes using the specified charsetName The length of the new String is a function of the charset and hence may not be equal to the length of the byte array
ByteArrayOutputStream.write(int)	Writes the specified byte to this byte array output stream
ByteArrayOutputStream.toByteArray()	Creates a newly allocated byte array Its size is the current size of this output stream and the valid contents of the buffer have been copied into it
ByteArrayOutputStream.toString()	Converts the buffer s contents into a string decoding bytes using the platform s default character set The length of the new String is a function of the character set and hence may not be equal to the size of the buffer
ByteArrayOutputStream.ByteArrayOutputStream()	Creates a new byte array output stream The buffer capacity is initially 32 bytes though its size increases if necessary
ByteArrayOutputStream.toString(int)	Creates a newly allocated string Its size is the current size of the output stream and the valid contents of the buffer have been copied into it Each character c in the resulting string is constructed from the corresponding element b in the byte array such that c char hibyte 0xff 8 b 0xff
ByteArrayOutputStream.write(byte[],int,int)	Writes len bytes from the specified byte array starting at offset off to this byte array output stream
